# Rendering Library Guidelines

**Purpose**: Core rendering utilities and optimizations for the 3D engine.

## Structure

- `BVHManager.ts` - Bounding Volume Hierarchy optimization manager
- `rendering.ts` - Core rendering utilities (culling, LOD, etc.)
- `shapes/` - Shape descriptors and registry
- `RendererFactory.ts` - Renderer initialization

## BVH System (Spatial Acceleration)

### Overview

The BVH (Bounding Volume Hierarchy) system provides spatial acceleration for:

- **Accelerated Raycasting**: Up to 10-100x faster ray intersection tests
- **Frustum Culling**: Efficient visibility determination for large scenes
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track culling effectiveness

### Architecture

#### BVHManager (`BVHManager.ts`)

Core service that manages BVH structures for all meshes in the scene.

**Key Features:**

- Automatic BVH construction for registered meshes
- Configurable construction strategy (SAH, CENTER, AVERAGE)
- Periodic BVH updates for dynamic geometry
- Frustum culling acceleration
- Performance statistics

**Configuration:**

```typescript
{
  enableFrustumCulling: boolean; // Enable/disable frustum culling
  enableRaycastAcceleration: boolean; // Enable/disable BVH raycasting
  updateInterval: number; // Milliseconds between updates
  maxLeafTris: number; // Triangles per BVH leaf (10-20 recommended)
  strategy: 'SAH' | 'CENTER' | 'AVERAGE'; // Construction algorithm
}
```

**Usage:**

```typescript
import { getBVHManager } from '@core/lib/rendering/BVHManager';

const bvhManager = getBVHManager();
bvhManager.registerMesh(mesh, meshId);
bvhManager.update(deltaTime);
```

#### BVH System (`src/core/systems/bvhSystem.ts`)

ECS system integration for BVH optimization.

**Features:**

- Automatic initialization with scene and camera
- Per-frame BVH updates
- Frustum culling execution
- Performance logging

**Integration:**
The BVH system is automatically initialized in `EngineLoop.tsx` and runs every frame.

### Configuration

#### Enabling BVH (Opt-In)

**IMPORTANT**: BVH is **disabled by default** to prevent WebGL context loss on large scenes. Enable it only when:

- You have tested it with your scene
- Your scene has 500+ objects that would benefit from culling
- You're experiencing performance issues with raycasting

Enable via the engine store:

```typescript
import { useEngineStore } from '@core/state/engineStore';

const { bvhCulling, setBvhCulling } = useEngineStore();
setBvhCulling(true); // Enable BVH culling - scene will be processed
```

**Note**: When enabling for the first time, the system will process all meshes in the scene. For large scenes (1000+ meshes), this may take a few seconds.

### Performance Considerations

#### When to Use BVH

- **Large Scenes**: Scenes with 1000+ objects benefit significantly
- **Complex Geometry**: High poly meshes (10k+ triangles)
- **Frequent Raycasting**: Games with mouse picking, shooting, etc.

#### BVH Construction Cost

- Initial build: ~1-5ms per mesh (depends on triangle count)
- Updates: Only when geometry changes
- Memory: ~1-5% overhead per mesh

#### Optimal Settings

- **maxLeafTris**: 10 (default) - good balance for most scenes
  - Lower (5): Better query performance, slower builds
  - Higher (20): Faster builds, slower queries
- **strategy**: 'SAH' (default) - best quality, slowest build
  - 'CENTER': Fast builds, decent quality
  - 'AVERAGE': Middle ground

#### Performance Gains

- **Raycasting**: 10-100x faster (scene dependent)
- **Frustum Culling**: 2-5x faster culling checks
- **Large Scenes**: Can render 10x more objects at same framerate

### Implementation Details

#### Three.js Integration

BVH is integrated directly into Three.js prototypes:

- `BufferGeometry.computeBoundsTree()` - Build BVH
- `BufferGeometry.disposeBoundsTree()` - Clean up BVH
- `Mesh.raycast()` - Accelerated raycasting

#### Automatic Registration

Meshes are automatically registered when scenes are loaded. For dynamic meshes:

```typescript
import { registerMeshWithBVH } from '@core/systems/bvhSystem';

// Register dynamically created mesh
registerMeshWithBVH(newMesh, 'unique-id');

// Unregister when removed
import { unregisterMeshFromBVH } from '@core/systems/bvhSystem';
unregisterMeshFromBVH('unique-id');
```

### Debugging

Enable debug logging to monitor BVH performance:

```typescript
import { Logger } from '@core/lib/logger';

// Stats are logged every 10 seconds showing:
// - Total objects in scene
// - Culled objects
// - Visible objects
// - Culling ratio
```

### Limitations & Considerations

- **WebGL Context**: Processing very large scenes (2000+ complex meshes) can cause WebGL context loss
  - BVH is disabled by default for safety
  - Enable only after testing with your specific scene
  - Consider enabling progressively or during loading screens
- **Dynamic Geometry**: Requires BVH rebuild when vertices change
- **Instanced Meshes**: Each instance needs separate BVH
- **Memory**: Additional memory per mesh (~1-5%)
- **Initialization Cost**: Large scenes may take 1-5 seconds to process all meshes

### Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Test BVH with a small scene first
2. **Monitor Performance**: Watch for WebGL errors in console
3. **Gradual Rollout**: Enable BVH progressively as scene complexity grows
4. **Loading Screens**: Process BVH during loading/initialization phases
5. **Error Recovery**: System auto-disables on errors to prevent crashes

### Future Enhancements

- Automatic LOD integration with BVH
- Occlusion culling using BVH
- Spatial partitioning (octree) for very large scenes
- Multi-threaded BVH construction

## Asset Optimization Pipeline

### Overview

Automatic model optimization is integrated into the development and build workflow to reduce file sizes, improve load times, and enhance runtime performance.

### How It Works

The optimization system runs after asset sync to optimize all served models:

1. **Sync**: Copy models from `src/game/assets/` to `public/assets/`
2. **Scan**: Find all GLB/GLTF files in `public/assets/models/` (what gets served)
3. **Check**: Compare file hashes against manifest to detect changes
4. **Optimize**: Apply glTF-Transform optimizations to changed files
5. **Track**: Update manifest with new file hashes

### Integration Points

#### Development Workflow

```bash
yarn dev         # Auto-optimizes changed models, then starts dev server
yarn optimize    # Manually run optimization with progress output
yarn optimize:force  # Force re-optimization of all models
```

#### Build Workflow

```bash
yarn build       # Optimizes models as part of production build
```

### Optimization Techniques Applied

The system uses `@gltf-transform/functions` to apply several optimizations:

1. **Prune**: Removes unused nodes, materials, textures, and accessories
2. **Dedup**: Merges duplicate vertex and texture data
3. **Weld**: Merges duplicate vertices within epsilon threshold
4. **Quantize**: Reduces precision of vertex attributes to save bandwidth
   - Position: 14 bits (sub-millimeter precision)
   - Normals: 10 bits
   - UVs: 12 bits
   - Colors: 8 bits

### Performance Impact

**File Size Reduction:**

- Typical savings: 30-60% reduction in file size
- Depends on model complexity and redundancy

**Runtime Performance:**

- Smaller files = faster network transfer
- Quantized attributes = less GPU memory bandwidth
- Welded vertices = better GPU cache utilization

### Double-Optimization Prevention

The system uses a SHA-256 hash manifest (`.model-optimization-manifest.json`) to track optimized files:

- Only processes files that have changed since last optimization
- Prevents redundant processing on every dev server start
- Manifest is gitignored (local cache only)

**Manifest Structure:**

```json
{
  "optimized": {
    "public/assets/models/Example/model.glb": "sha256-hash..."
  }
}
```

**Important**: The system optimizes `public/assets/models/` (what gets served at runtime) rather than source files, ensuring all models are optimized regardless of whether they're synced from `src/` or added directly to `public/`.

### Script Location

`scripts/optimize-models.js` - Main optimization script

### Configuration

Edit `scripts/optimize-models.js` to adjust:

- Quantization bit depths (line 94-100)
- Enable/disable simplification (commented by default)
- Add additional optimization passes

### Troubleshooting

**Issue: Models look corrupted after optimization**

- Solution: Reduce quantization bit depths or disable quantize step

**Issue: Optimization takes too long**

- Solution: Use `--silent` flag to skip progress output
- Already enabled by default in dev/build scripts

**Issue: Need to re-optimize all models**

- Solution: Run `yarn optimize:force` or delete `.model-optimization-manifest.json`

### Best Practices

1. **Test First**: Run `yarn optimize` manually to see results before committing
2. **Check Quality**: Verify optimized models look correct in your scene
3. **Source Control**: Keep original high-quality models in `src/game/assets/` in version control
4. **Iterative**: Start with conservative settings, increase aggressiveness as needed
5. **Public Assets**: Models added directly to `public/assets/models/` will also be optimized

### Advanced: Mesh Simplification

For polygon reduction, uncomment the simplification step in `scripts/optimize-models.js`:

```typescript
// Reduce polygon count by 10% with 0.1% error tolerance
simplify({ ratio: 0.9, error: 0.001 });
```

**Note**: Test carefully - aggressive simplification can degrade visual quality

### Related Systems

- **Asset Sync** (`scripts/sync-assets.js`): Copies optimized models to `public/assets/`
- **BVH System**: Benefits from optimized geometry (fewer triangles = faster BVH)
- **LOD System**: Provides multiple quality variants of optimized models

## LOD (Level of Detail) System

### Overview

The LOD system provides automatic quality management for 3D models with named quality variants:

- **original**: Base optimized model (default)
- **high_fidelity**: 75% polygon reduction with minimal visual degradation
- **low_fidelity**: 35% polygon reduction for maximum performance

### Architecture

#### LODManager (`LODManager.ts`)

Singleton service for global LOD quality management.

**Key Features:**

- Global quality setting affecting all models
- Distance-based auto-switching (optional)
- Type-safe quality variants
- Path resolution for LOD files
- Performance monitoring

**Configuration:**

```typescript
{
  quality: 'original' | 'high_fidelity' | 'low_fidelity';
  autoSwitch: boolean;
  distanceThresholds: {
    high: number;
    low: number;
  }
}
```

**Usage:**

```typescript
import { lodManager } from '@core/lib/rendering/LODManager';

// Set global quality
lodManager.setQuality('low_fidelity');

// Enable distance-based switching
lodManager.setAutoSwitch(true);
lodManager.setDistanceThresholds(50, 100);

// Get LOD path for a model
const lodPath = lodManager.getLODPath('/assets/models/Character/glb/Character.glb');
// Returns: /assets/models/Character/lod/Character.low_fidelity.glb
```

#### React Integration

**useLODModel Hook** (`src/core/hooks/useLODModel.ts`)

React hook for automatic LOD-aware model path resolution.

```typescript
import { useLODModel } from '@core/hooks/useLODModel';

// Automatically uses global quality
const lodPath = useLODModel({ basePath: modelPath });

// Override quality for specific model
const lodPath = useLODModel({ basePath: modelPath, quality: 'high_fidelity' });

// Distance-based quality (requires auto-switch enabled)
const lodPath = useLODModel({ basePath: modelPath, distance: cameraDistance });
```

**useLODPaths Hook**

Returns all LOD paths for a model:

```typescript
const paths = useLODPaths(basePath);
// { original: '...', high_fidelity: '...', low_fidelity: '...' }
```

**useLODQuality Hook**

Reactive hook for current global quality:

```typescript
const quality = useLODQuality();
// Updates when lodManager.setQuality() is called
```

### Integration Points

#### Automatic Integration

The LOD system is automatically integrated with the custom model loading pipeline:

**EntityMesh Component** (`src/editor/components/panels/ViewportPanel/components/EntityMesh.tsx`)

```typescript
// LOD hook automatically applied to all custom models
const lodPath = useLODModel({ basePath: modelPath });
const { scene } = useGLTF(lodPath); // Uses LOD-aware path
```

**No code changes required** - all custom models automatically use the LOD system.

### File Structure

LOD variants are stored alongside original models:

```
public/assets/models/
└── Character/
    ├── glb/
    │   └── Character.glb                    # Original optimized model
    └── lod/
        ├── Character.high_fidelity.glb      # 75% quality variant
        └── Character.low_fidelity.glb       # 35% quality variant
```

### Generation Pipeline

LOD variants are automatically generated during model optimization:

1. **Original**: Base model goes through optimization pipeline (prune, dedup, weld, quantize)
2. **High Fidelity**: Original + simplify(ratio: 0.75, error: 0.0005)
3. **Low Fidelity**: Original + simplify(ratio: 0.35, error: 0.002)

Configuration in `.model-optimization.config.json`:

```json
{
  "lod": {
    "enabled": true,
    "variants": {
      "high_fidelity": { "ratio": 0.75, "error": 0.0005 },
      "low_fidelity": { "ratio": 0.35, "error": 0.002 }
    }
  }
}
```

### Performance Impact

**Example: NightStalker Model**

- Original: 11,837 triangles (100%)
- High Fidelity: 11,685 triangles (98.7%)
- Low Fidelity: 6,296 triangles (53.2%)

**Expected FPS Improvements (low_fidelity):**

- 10-20 models: +5-10% FPS
- 50-100 models: +15-25% FPS
- 500+ models: +40-60% FPS

**File Sizes:**

- High fidelity: ~5-10% larger than original (more vertices)
- Low fidelity: ~20-40% smaller than original (fewer vertices)

### Distance-Based Auto-Switching

Enable automatic quality switching based on camera distance:

```typescript
import { lodManager } from '@core';

lodManager.setAutoSwitch(true);
lodManager.setDistanceThresholds(50, 100);

// Models will automatically switch:
// - < 50 units: original
// - 50-100 units: high_fidelity
// - > 100 units: low_fidelity
```

**Best for:**

- Open world games
- Large scenes with many models
- Performance-critical applications

### Testing

**Unit Tests:** `src/core/lib/rendering/__tests__/LODManager.test.ts`

- 24 tests covering all functionality
- Quality management, auto-switching, path resolution, edge cases

**Integration Tests:** `src/core/hooks/__tests__/useLODModel.test.tsx`

- 9 tests covering React hook behavior
- Default behavior, overrides, distance-based switching

**Run tests:**

```bash
yarn vitest run src/core/lib/rendering/__tests__/LODManager.test.ts
yarn vitest run src/core/hooks/__tests__/useLODModel.test.tsx
```

### Best Practices

1. **Start with original**: Test your scene with original quality first
2. **Profile performance**: Use low_fidelity for performance-critical scenes
3. **Distance-based**: Enable auto-switching for large open scenes
4. **Override selectively**: Use quality override for hero models that should always be high quality
5. **Monitor FPS**: Measure actual performance gains in your specific use case

### Troubleshooting

**Issue: LOD file not found**

- Solution: Run `yarn optimize` to generate LOD variants
- Check that `.model-optimization.config.json` has `lod.enabled: true`

**Issue: Models not switching quality**

- Solution: Check that `useLODModel` hook is being used in EntityMesh
- Verify that `lodManager.setQuality()` is being called

**Issue: Visual quality too low**

- Solution: Adjust `ratio` and `error` values in config
- Use high_fidelity variant instead of low_fidelity
- Override quality for specific models

### Future Enhancements

- UI for runtime quality switching
- Performance profiler integration
- Automatic quality recommendation based on FPS
- Per-material LOD support
- Texture LOD integration
